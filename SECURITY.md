# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

WeatherGuard takes security seriously, especially given that we handle location data and emergency communications. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### API Key Security
- **No Hardcoded Keys**: All API keys are stored in environment variables
- **Environment Isolation**: Development and production keys are separate
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of API keys is recommended
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for all external API calls

### Data Privacy
- **Location Data**: User location data is processed client-side when possible
- **Temporary Storage**: Location data is not permanently stored without consent
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data transmission uses HTTPS
- **Permission Controls**: Granular privacy controls for location sharing

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets stored in `.env.local` (not committed)
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers for API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Contact Information
- **Primary**: yakkalasunayana1605@gmail.com
- **Team**: teamnpcars@gmail.com
- **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] WeatherGuard Vulnerability Report`

### What to Include
1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
4. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
5. **Your Contact Info**: For follow-up questions

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Implementation**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_secure_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_secure_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_secure_key_here

# Firebase Configuration (if using authentication)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Security Headers
WeatherGuard implements the following security headers:
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Prevents XSS attacks
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME sniffing
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS

## üöÄ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** from users and external APIs
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive data
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities
6. **Use HTTPS** for all external communications

### For Users
1. **Review permissions** before sharing location data
2. **Use strong passwords** if authentication is enabled
3. **Keep the app updated** to receive security patches
4. **Report suspicious behavior** immediately
5. **Use secure networks** when accessing the application

### For Administrators
1. **Regularly rotate API keys**
2. **Monitor API usage** for unusual patterns
3. **Keep server software updated**
4. **Implement monitoring and alerting**
5. **Regular security audits**

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All API keys are in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive data
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are configured

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] API keys rotated quarterly
- [ ] Dependencies updated monthly
- [ ] Security logs reviewed weekly
- [ ] Penetration testing annually
- [ ] Security training for team members

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Weather API Keys
- API keys are exposed client-side for weather data
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Keys have limited scope (weather data only)
- Consider using a proxy server for production

### Location Data
- Browser geolocation requires user consent
- Location precision can be adjusted
- Sharing permissions are granular
- Data is not stored long-term without consent

### Emergency Features
- Emergency broadcasts bypass normal privacy settings
- Clear user consent required for emergency overrides
- Audit logs for emergency activations

## üìö Security Resources

### External Security Tools
- [OWASP Security Guidelines](https://owasp.org/)
- [Mozilla Security Best Practices](https://infosec.mozilla.org/)
- [Next.js Security Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/security-headers)

### Security Scanning
- Regular dependency scanning with `npm audit`
- Code security analysis with ESLint security rules
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
