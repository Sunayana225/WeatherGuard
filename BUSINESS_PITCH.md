## üìã Demo Script (4-6 Minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Imagine this: A wildfire is approaching your neighborhood. Your spouse is at work 20 miles away, your college daughter is studying abroad in Tokyo, and your elderly parents live in Florida. You need to coordinate evacuation plans, check on everyone's safety, and monitor multiple weather conditions - all while emergency sirens are blaring.

Currently, this requires juggling 5 different apps. We built a better way."

### Problem Statement (45 seconds)
"Today's families are more distributed than ever, yet emergency preparedness tools are fragmented. During Hurricane Ian, families spent precious minutes switching between Find My, Weather Channel, local news apps, and text messages. When disasters strike, every second counts.

Our research shows 73% of families use 4 or more apps during emergencies. This fragmentation costs time, creates confusion, and can literally save lives."

Our freemium model starts at $4.99/month for families. With just 1% market penetration, that's $270 million in annual revenue."

### Competitive Advantage (30 seconds)
"No one else combines weather, disasters, and family tracking globally. Apple's Find My? Location only. Life360? Limited disaster data. Weather apps? No family features. We're the only unified solution."
